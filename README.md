## Overview

This repository contains code used in my final year project 'Optimal Trajectory Generation for a Human Robot System Compensating for Impaired Gait'.

**Knee Model Tests** contains various basic knee model initialisations for use in OpenSim with variable complexity. knee_model.cpp is the most basic, followed by knee_model_v2.cpp which attempts to integrate muscle functionality to the model, followed by knee_model_v3.cpp which attempts to add ligament functionality.
